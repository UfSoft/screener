In order to reset your password you must first confirm this change.

In order to confirm this new password please go to the following address:
  ${ url_for(change, force_external=True) }

If the above line is broken, go to the following URL and insert the given hash:
   URL: ${ url_for(change, include_hash=False, force_external=True) }
  HASH: ${ change.hash }

Until you confirm this change, the old password is still valid.
If it wasn't you requesting the password reset, don't worry, unless you confirm
the change, your old password is still safe.
